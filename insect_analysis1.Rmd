## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load in data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

insect = read.csv("Bug data - Sheet2.csv")

insect.2015 = insect %>% filter(Site == 2015)
insect.2007 = insect %>% filter(Site == 2007) 
insect.2013 = insect %>% filter(Site == 2013) 
```

Total Abundance by order
```{r}
# 2013
ggplot(data = insect.2013, aes(Order)) + geom_bar()

# 2015
ggplot(data = insect.2015, aes(Order)) + geom_bar()

# 2007
ggplot(data = insect.2007, aes(Order)) + geom_bar()
```
